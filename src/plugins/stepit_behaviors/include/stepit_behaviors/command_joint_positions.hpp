/**
 * @brief Sends joints to positions through a position controller, and waits
 * until they are there.
 *
 * A position controller, e.g. a position_controllers/JointGroupPositionController,
 * takes one position per joint it is configured with, in order, on its
 * `~/commands` topic, and the hardware moves there on its own profile: on
 * StepIt, the trapezoid of the microcontroller, as fast as the motors allow.
 * The message names no joint, so moving some joints means sending the others
 * where they already are: `controller_joints` lists the joints of the
 * controller, in its order, and the positions of the others come from the
 * latest joint state.
 *
 * It succeeds once every moved joint is within `tolerance` of its target and
 * has stopped, as read on the joint states, and fails after `timeout`
 * seconds. The joints are not synchronised: each one runs its own profile.
 *
 * Backlash: given `approach_from` and `approach_to`, every moved joint reaches
 * its target moving in the direction from the one to the other, e.g. from the
 * first to the last position of a stack. A joint that would get there moving
 * the other way first goes past its target by its overshoot, then back to it,
 * so that its gears always end loaded the same way. A joint already at its
 * target stays, as it got there this way, unless `overshoot_in_place` says
 * that it may not have, e.g. driven there by hand. The overshoot of a joint is the parameter `overshoot.<joint>` of the
 * commander's node, in radians, from the robot's parameter file, unless the
 * port `overshoot` gives it; a joint without one goes straight.
 *
 * Halting it, or a timeout, deactivates the position controller, without
 * waiting for the answer: the hardware then brakes every joint the controller
 * released to rest, on its own profile, where it naturally stops. Sending the
 * joints where they are would not do: a joint moving at speed cannot stop
 * there, it would brake past it and come back. The next objective activates
 * the controller it needs, as every motion objective does first.
