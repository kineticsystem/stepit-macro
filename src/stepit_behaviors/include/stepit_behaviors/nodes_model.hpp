 * and their ports from this file instead. It is generated from the real
 * registration, ports added by behaviortree_ros2 included. The committed copy is
 * src/stepit_objectives/objectives/stepit_behaviors.xml, written by the
 * write_nodes_model program, and test_nodes_model checks it is up to date.
